# FACE-MASK-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING


#**COVID-19 Face Mask Detector Project**

In this project, we developed a COVID-19 face mask detector using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. Our approach involved the following key steps:

1. **Model Training**:
   - We trained a two-class model to distinguish between individuals wearing masks and those not wearing masks.
   - MobileNetV2 was fine-tuned on our custom mask/no mask dataset, resulting in a highly accurate classifier with approximately 99% accuracy.

2. **Application**:
   - The trained face mask classifier was then applied to images. This involved detecting faces within the images and classifying them as either mask-wearing or not mask-wearing.

This project showcases the effective use of deep learning techniques for real-world applications, contributing to public health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
